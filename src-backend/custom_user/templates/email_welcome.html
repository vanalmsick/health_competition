        <ul>
            <li>Each competition has its own activity goals.</li>
            <li>You earn <b>1 point for every 1%</b> progress toward a goal.</li>
            <li>For example, if the goal is 100 minutes of exercise and you complete 50 minutes, you earn 50 points.</li>
            <li><i>Note:</i> Some goals have <b>minimum or maximum limits</b>. Activities above/below these limits wonâ€™t earn you points and are marked with an asterisk (*).</li>
            <li>Hover over a goal to view its limits, or over the asterisk for more details.</li>
